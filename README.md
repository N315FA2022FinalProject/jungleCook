This is the final project for NEWM-N315 called Jungle Cook. This project consisted of creating a web application from scratch, following the design of an Adobe XD prototype. This is a website where you can <strong>Create, Read, Update, </strong> and <strong> Delete</strong> recipes, making this a CRUD application. In total, this project took about 5 weeks to complete. The specific functionality is listed below:

CREATE:
In this site, you are able to <i>create</i> a recipe. There is a page that comes up one you log into our site that will allow you to create a recipe from scratch. You can add an image, create some steps for the recipe, add ingredients, and any other basic information needed to have a new, personalized recipe.

READ:
You will be able to <i>read</i> any recipes as well. We have some recipes created on the site by default in our browse page, either to get you started on some recipes or give you some ideas of which recipes you should be adding. Each has their own description on the site.

UPDATE:
<i>Updating</i> your recipes on the site will allow you to make any changes to the recipe if an ingredient changed, you want to update the image, or if you want to give it a different description! It is all laid out in one page to edit your recipe to customize it better for you.

DELETE:
Finally, you will be able to <i>delete</i> your recipes. If you changed your mind about the recipe or just have some new ones you want to have displayed, you can view your recipes and hit the delete button to get rid of it entirely.

<strong>Responsibilities:</strong>

Zaydee worked on the home page, the your recipe page, the log in page, and the edit page. She also worked on the footer of the pages, and worked on any responsiveness and functionality for her assigned pages.
